This project is solving the Take the Earth On a Hike: Offline Access To Remote Sensing Data challenge.
This project aims to achieve wireless remote transfer data, access on information about the area while offline. We aim to achieve this by locating base stations on different areas on the Earth, which would be provided with hard drives, and communicate with the user. The base stations would be charged with electricity by different power sources, including renewable energy sources when it's proper. The base stations would be able to operate even on other planets.
